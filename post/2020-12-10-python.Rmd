##Introduction 

Do you dream in codes? Do you ever think about making math harder than it needs to be? Then this post is the right one for you! 

In this post, I'll be showing a couple of ways to do simple arithmetic in python and R but with a twist.


##Yay Math 

As a refresher, here are some examples of how to run some basic codes:

```{R}
2+2
4*67899
2347891234/23
```


But why would you want to settle for numbers when you can write everything out? Here is an example in R:

```{R}
twothousand <- c(2000)
fivethousandsixhundred <- c(5600)
twothousand*fivethousandsixhundred
twothousand/fivethousandsixhundred
(2*twothousand) - (5*fivethousandsixhundred)/2
```

And because R isn't enough, here it is in python: 
```{python}
three = 3
two = 2
three + two 
mygod = 123423342424
ohno = 12323434723843984
mygod + ohno
```
